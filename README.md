TUCCA's Automated RNA-Seq Snakemake Pipeline using Salmon and DESeq2

# Installation for Tufts HPC Users

## 1. Get off of a login node

```bash
srun -p preempt -t 1-2:30:00 -n 2 --mem=32G --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash
```

## 2. Clone the repository

Go to the desired directory/folder on your file system on the Tufts HPC, then
clone/get the repository and move into the respective directory with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benjibromberg/tucca-rna-seq.git
```

## 3. Dependencies installation

For improved reproducibility and reusability of the workflow,
each individual step of the workflow runs either in its own [Conda][conda]
virtual environemnt. As a consequence, running this workflow has very few 
individual dependencies.

To install the necessary dependencies run:

```bash
module load miniforge/24.7.1-py312
conda env create -f tucca-rna-seq/install/base.yaml
conda env create -f tucca-rna-seq/install/snakemake.yaml
```

# Set-Up the `config` Directory

# Running the Pipeline

To run the pipeline:

```bash
cd tucca-rna-seq
module load miniforge/24.7.1-py312
sh run.sh <snakemake_target_rule> <extra_snakemake_parameters>
```

To perform a dry-run of the pipeline:

```bash
cd tucca-rna-seq
module load miniforge/24.7.1-py312
sh run.sh <snakemake_target_rule> -np <extra_snakemake_parameters>
```

When performing a dry-run using the -n (or --dry-run) flag, Snakemake will only
show the execution plan instead of actually performing the steps. The -p flag
instructs Snakemake to also print the resulting shell command for illustration.
